# Microsoft Career Bot
If you have ever represented Microsoft at a career fair, you know that prospective job candidates tend to ask the same questions: around benefits, locations, roles, education/work experience requirements, etc.  Wouldn’t it be fabulous to have a way to automate responses to some of these common questions, as well as introduce potential job candidates to the power of the technology that we build here at Microsoft?  Enter the Microsoft Career Bot!  This is a tool that can be used by recruiters, evangelists, or anyone else at career fairs, universities, and large events like the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.  Students can text the bot to entertain and inform themselves while they are waiting in line to talk to their Microsoft representative, or text it afterwards if they think of further questions. Keep in mind that there are numerous application of the bot techologies in the HR and Marketing space!
 
Try asking things like:
+ Help I have an interview!!!!
+ Can I work for Microsoft from England?
+ If I’m from New Zealand, do I need a work visa?
